# KPP vision for sprint players

## Introduction

Hello. I recently came up with a general idea of how I learned to see kpp when stacking, and how I find the stacking solutions. I hope this will be useful to everyone.

To reduce KPP, we need to reduce how many keys are pressed. I know, hard to believe. In tetris, you can divide keys into three categories: rotation, movement, and "other" keys such as hard drop, hold, and soft drop. I'll go over each and the strategies for them

# The strats

## Avoiding hard drops

You can't avoid or reduce hard drops, you have to use it every piece no matter what. Sorry.

## Avoiding tucks.

Soft dropping pieces and then moving them around, trying to tuck them or spin them is pretty slow. To avoid them, simply avoid making any holes of any kind in your stack. This is a really basic skill, no matter how much of a beginner you are, I'm sure
you'll figure it out. Here are some examples of piece placements to avoid:

If you're a beginner reading this, I don't want to gatekeep knowledge here, but I'd only recommend reading or applying what's further once you get at least a sub 50 sprint (or sub 1:30 for capped games such as Tetris Effect and Puyo Tetris). The methods described
down below can reduce how many stacking options you can choose from, and will ruin your stack if you're not good at visualising at least 2 next pieces.

## Reducing movement

In my opinion, this is more important for speed than avoiding rotations. That's why I'm putting it first, before reducing rotations. See the "reducing rotations" chapter for explanations.

Reducing movement essentially means avoiding double taps and tapbacks, because mathematically, out of 100 pieces in a sprint, 80ish will use DAS. A good sprint run with 6-3 can have less than 5 tapbacks and no double taps at all. Or 2-3 double taps and 2-3 tapbacks
if you use double tap finesse

To avoid tapbacks and double taps, you just need to maximize how many non-tapbacks you do. It's a lot easier to think this way. There are three zones without tapbacks or double taps: the left wall, the spawn point, and the right wall.
I'll finish writing this tomorrow

## Reducing rotations

There's a chance you're wasting your time by avoiding rotations:
1. Movement has tapbacks and double taps, while rotations
only require one button pressed, which can be done more or less instantly anyway. 
2. You can rotate pieces while you're waiting for DAS. In other words, the rotation doesn't matter in that case, because rotated or not, your bottleneck is waiting for DAS.
3. When you're moving pieces without DAS, you can move the piece at the same time as rotating them. You can argue that in this case, the rotation also doesn't matter, but we don't know for sure. I still prefer not rotating when possible, it feels faster to me.

Because of the above, avoiding rotations likely only matters for pieces placed at the spawn point, and for piece placements that are DAS preserved. In other words, avoiding rotations is probably useless for speed before you learn how to avoid movement.
But hey, at least your kpp will be lower, whether it makes you faster or not. I don't know about you, but I love when number go down.
